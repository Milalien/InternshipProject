# InternshipProject
 
This is a modified version of a project I completed as a part of my internship in 2024.
I deleted all information of the actual client etc., and added a config.txt file where you can find the original configuration of the database for this project.

The page itself is a simple website for a local one-man company, with a admin side that can be used to update the page easily.

This was the first project I built using PHP, and learned a lot along the way. With more time and resources I would have optimized the database and server-side functions more, but the client was happy with the result and that's the main goal.
